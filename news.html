                <h2>Scholarship (full & part) Openings for 2022</h2>
                <p>Scholarship is a financial aid provided to a student on certain grounds, usually 
                    academic merit. Scholarship, unlike student loans, does not have to be paid 
                    back and they are a nice approach to assist students in attaining their 
                    academic aspirations. They are funds awarded to relieve students 
                    (prospective and already enrolled) and their families of a significant part of the 
                    financial commitments of higher education. Scholarships are awarded by different 
                    organisations and bodies for both undergraduate and postgraduate studies in this university.</p><br>

                <p>There are more than 700 scholarships in the field of education and research. 
                    Students will get contact details of our partners that offer scholarship 
                    programs when they select the degree level and course in which they are planning to 
                    continue their education.
                    Once doctoral students complete their degree courses, they will get employment notifications,
                    job alerts, and interview calls from reputed global business conglomerates and industries.</p><br>
                
                <p>Eligibility for a scholarship depends entirely on the scholarship; there is no general
                    rule of thumb on whether you are eligible for a financial award. Some scholarships 
                    require students to have a certain TOEFL score; some ask that you are from a certain 
                    country; some ask for you to have a certain grade point average. You will need to do 
                    your own research to see if you are eligible for a scholarship. It can be confusing, 
                    but our university admissions officers and financial aid experts are avaialble to 
                    help you get as much money as you qualify for.</p><br>

                <p>Apply for any of the available scholarships and stay glued to your email
                    for updates about your application. Kindly note that this is only applicable
                    for those who have been admitted into any of our programs as your admission 
                    letter will be important in your application process.
